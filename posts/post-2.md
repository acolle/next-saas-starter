# The Client

Antarctica is where for decades cutting edge science has been applied to assist in experimentation and observation. It is a shining example of international preservation governance through collaboration. In this pristine environment, the International Polar Foundation welcomed in 2009 the world’s first “zero emission” scientific research station, the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica.

# Risks & Consequences

The fire risks involved in this application are related to electrical faults due to the prevalence of electrical equipment within the station. Coupled with human error, a reliable and efficient firefighting system to safeguard its wooden structure and the vastly expensive sensitive scientific equipment was required. Importantly, different material/fuel may combust so the fire the extinguishing system had to be effective for A, B, C, F, classes of fire and rapidly responsive to avoid further damage to assets or danger to human lives.

# The Task

To replace the water mist system in roof level UPS rooms with a bespoke and low maintenance fire firefighting system. The protection against fire of these rooms by extension offers protection to the integrity of the Station’s wooden structure and the other expensive sensitive scientific equipment housed there in from fire ensuring the uninterrupted operation and service they provide. Furthermore protection is offered to the wellbeing of the station’s occupants. Only a long-life, eco-friendly system with attested performance capabilities within varying temperatures could match the project’s specific requirements and applications.

# Why FirePro?

The Station’s remoteness and other particularities posed a huge transportation and logistical challenge. These required an easily transportable, easily installed, low maintenance fire suppression system. Also needed was a system that is durable and one that can withstand and operate in harsh climatic conditions. After long deliberations the project’s consultants, selected FirePro as it fulfilled all design prerequisites and specifications. What is more, FirePro’s environment friendly attributes go-hand-in-glove with the station that is decisively designed with eco-friendly materials and employs exploitation of clean energy and waste management practices.

# Results of Implementation

FirePro systems were installed in various key locations to protect both people and equipment. The technology matches the polar station’s Green Tech characteristics while providing a highly effective fire suppression system ready to respond to any emergency scenario. The fact that FirePro units have low maintenance requirements and a very long active life span provides further assurances to resident scientists and other investors.
