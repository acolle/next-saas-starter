# The Client

The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is Europe’s tallest observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames. Since its opening in 2000, the 135-meter tall structure, with its 32 high-tech glass capsules, has become an iconic symbol of modern London. Accommodating up to 25 people per capsule, it offers unparalleled panoramic views, attracting 3.75 millions of visitors annually and firmly establishing itself as a premier tourist attraction. The iconic landmark is dependent on its essential power and standby infrastructure for continued operation, almost every day of the year.

# Risks & Consequences

The 10-year overhaul of the original HFC gas suppression system identified issues with the enclosure integrity as well as the environmental concerns with HFC agents due to their high global warming potential and long atmospheric lifetime. FirePro’s condensed aerosol suppression technology provided the end-users with an environmentally friendly alternative, and with minor modifications, an approved and cost-effective engineering solution.

# The Task

New fire suppression solutions in both room total-flooding and in-cabinet configurations should be provided to protect the landmark’s electromechanical assets. After presenting compelling evidence of FirePro’s efficacy, compliance and benefits, Global Fire & Security was awarded the project. Before installing and commissioning the FirePro systems, they safely removed the existing gas suppression systems. Some enclosures featured large louvered openings, posing an agent leakage and holdtime challenge. Using the manufacturer’s leakage calculation tool, the FirePro systems were engineered with an additional timed agent release fulfilling the requirements of BS EN 15276 to which FirePro systems are BSI and KIWA certified.

# Why FirePro?

FirePro is currently the only condensed aerosol suppression system with LPCB certification. Supported by a large network of independent, third-party certificated, fire safety service providers, it ensures that design, installation and after-sales services are offered at the optimum time, quality and cost. The certification is provided by BRE on the basis of LPS 1204 Issue 3.2. The process is backed by readily available materials and full technical support from FirePro UK. Reference installations with fully satisfied users were available for the team’s inspection. Clients also benefit from a 15-year product lifespan confirmed by LPCB, BSI, UL, VDS and KIWA, offering a sustainable and environmentally sound solution.

# Results of Implementation

The implementation took only a few weeks and was completed without disrupting the general public’s enjoyment of the London Eye, one of the UK’s premier tourist attractions. The seamless installation of FirePro’s advanced suppression systems ensured enhanced safety without compromising visitor experience. The project’s success highlights FirePro’s efficiency and reliability, providing robust fire protection while maintaining normal operations.
